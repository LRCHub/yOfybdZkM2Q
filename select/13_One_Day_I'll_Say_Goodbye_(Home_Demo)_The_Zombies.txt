As blind as love made me
You can see, I am not too bright
The light I saw in her eyes
Was just greed their was no love

She will give me everything I ever wanted
Everything I want IÂ'll take from her, oh

One day IÂ'll say goodbye
Yes I will
And then IÂ'll leave her
One day IÂ'll say goodbye
Just like she said that to me

Tables turn in my mind
And IÂ'll find someway to leave her
Give her reason to feel
All the hurt she put in me

She will give me everything I ever wanted
Everything I want IÂ'll take from her, oh

One day IÂ'll say goodbye
Yes I will
And then IÂ'll leave her
One day IÂ'll say goodbye
Just as she said that to me

She will give me everything I ever wanted
Everything I want IÂ'll take from her, oh

One day IÂ'll say goodbye
Yes I will
And then IÂ'll leave her
One day IÂ'll say goodbye
Just as she said that to me

One day IÂ'll say goodbye
Yes I will
(One day IÂ'll say goodbye)
And then IÂ'll leave her
(Goodbye)
One day IÂ'll say goodbye
Just as she said that to me
